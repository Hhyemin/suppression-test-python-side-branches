# suppression-test-python-side-branches

This repository is used to test our analysis code for studying suppressed warnings.
The focus here is on
 * Python repositories
 * Pylint
 * The repositories with side branches

## Ground truth of this repository
Specifically, this is a repository used to test if we can get commits located at the main branch and the corresponding histories. If the commits originally come from the "side-branch", we expect to ignore it.
 * Totally with 2 branches:
     * main
     * side-branch
 * Only 1 Pylint suppression (add and delete at some point)

## Expected output of our analysis scripts
Total with 12 commits.   
Time order: C1, C2, ...,C12
